# Job-Crawler
 This is a web scraper for www.technopark.org site. The site  posts vacancies of jobs in Technopark,an IT park in Trivandrum. I wrote the code in Python 3.5. However, I have  converted the file to .exe so you need not have Python installed to run the program.I am not sure if the code will run on Linux or OSX. I will update this file once I have that confirmed.  The program scrapes the site for the job title, the company name and the link to the description of the job and writes it to a word document that it creates on the Desktop.   Feel free to use it, copy it or tweak it. If you can improve it please do so.   
 I am also including the python source code for those interested.
 Thanks. Happy Coding.
