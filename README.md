# Job-Crawler

> Author : Roni Rengit

### Description


This is a web scraper for the jobs section of www.technopark.org . 


The site posts vacancies of jobs in Technopark,an IT park in Trivandrum. I wrote the code in Python 3.5. However, I have  converted the file to .exe so you need not have Python installed to run the program. 

#### What does the program do?

The program scrapes the site for the job title, the company name and the link to the description of the job and writes it to a word document that it creates on the desktop.   


Feel free to use it, copy it or tweak it. If you can improve it please do so.   


I am also including the python source code for those interested.


Thanks. Happy Coding.
